# Troubleshoot

## **I have an error creating client features. It cannot get the encryption key for the database**

This means you are running in an environment where there is no secure key ring we can reach to store encryption keys. We always try to save the local encryption keys in the safest location we can reach and that normally is the secure key ring that your operating system provides.

In this case you can use the local file system to store the local encryption keys. This is insecure and you should be aware that if somebody has access to your file system they can get to the encryption keys.

If you still want to use the app, you will need to:

 1. Ensure you are logged out by doing `pass-cli logout --force`
 2. Set the environment variable `PROTON_PASS_KEY_PROVIDER` to `fs`.
 3. Login normally as you would.

## **On Windows it complains about `install.ps1` cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled**

It's possible that your computer has a restricted script execution policy set, either by you or via a company Device Management System.

In order to run the installation script without changing your system policy, open `Powershell` as your current user (not Administrator), move to the folder that contains `install.ps1`, and run:

```powershell
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

This command applies a bypass for this script execution without changing your current execution policy.

## SSH Agent troubleshooting

If you have issues with your SSH Agent in Proton Pass CLI, please try the following steps to see if a minimal scenario works on your setup:

1. If you are using Windows, make sure that the system default OpenSSH agent is disabled. To do so, press `Windows+R`, write `services.msc`, click OK, and then look for "OpenSSH Authentication Agent". Right-click it and select "Properties". There, set "Startup type" to "Disabled" and click OK. Make sure the service is now marked as Stopped.
2. Select a vault / Create a new temporary one to hold a new temporary SSH key.
3. Create a new SSH key in that vault: `pass-cli item create ssh-key generate --title "TempSshKey"`.
4. Start the SSH agent with debug logs: (macOS/Linux) `PASS_LOG_LEVEL=debug pass-cli ssh-agent start --vault-name YOUR_VAULT_NAME` / (Windows) `$env:PASS_LOG_LEVEL="debug"; pass-cli ssh-agent start --vault-name YOUR_VAULT_NAME`.
5. Open a new shell. If you are using macOS or Linux, run the `export` command that got printed on step 4. Then run `ssh-add -L`. If everything is working correctly, you should see your `TempSshKey` listed there, and a log message appear in your SSH Agent shell.
